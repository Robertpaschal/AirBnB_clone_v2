In this directory, I am learning web framework and how it all comes together. Specifically, I am learning to use  python flask framework and Jinja (a templating language) to host a dymanic web page. The server would be running off a database and then rendering the page to the end user along with relevant objects and data. Nothing needs to be hardcoded, it all works dynamically.
